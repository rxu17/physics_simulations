# Particle-Physics

##  Study of gluon decay 
**Purpose:** To generate a simple 2D model of a parton shower (conservation of momentum and energy)

## Background:


## Assumptions:
We treat all particles (gluons and quarks) as the same type.
All particles have negligible mass compared to its energy, so momentum is about
the same as the total energy.

Multiple Step Process:
- Generate random angles and energy percentage of original gluon article 
- Each particle is created indepedently from its parent particle
